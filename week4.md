#####Cenozoic Latitudinal Response Curves: Individualistic Changes in the Latitudinal Distributions of Marine Bivalves and Gastropods By Andrew Zaffos and Arnold Miller (2015)

####Article Summary
The authors wanted to know why bivalve genera tend to first occur in the tropics, when their last occurrences tend to be in the extratropics.`(They really point to this as a previous result.)` Additionally, if genera move in a poleward direction over its evolutionary history, then what is the driving factor (or factors) and can the migration be linked to any precise geologic event? The authors used Gaussian logistic regression to estimate the preferred latitude, peak abundance and latitudinal tolerance, which ~~forms~~`assumes` a normal bell curve `response`. The peak abundance is the maximum y value, preferred latitude is where the peak occurs on the x axis, and the latitudinal tolerance is equivalent to one standard deviation on each side of the maximum. The results of the linear regression slopes are all nearly flat for epoch to epoch comparisons.`(are they? they are definitely < 1)` This indicates that smaller range sizes are expanding and larger ranges are contracting.`(Not really! it means they are tending to move towards the tropics)' The data `(which adata?)` also produce a hollow curve model, allowing us to assume that smaller changes are more common than larger changes in latitudinal tolerance as well as in preferred latitude. A bootstrapping procedure was done in order to find out if these changes could be due to chance, which they believe is false. When comparing epoch-epoch changes with stage-stage changes, they found that bivalve genera are more likely to shift the center of their distribution than widen it. The authors also suggest that climatic cooling does not force greater changes in latitudinal distributions due to warming, as others have previously suggested. Additionally, the authors suggest that bivalve genera expand into the extra tropics by the use of “bridge species”, species that originate in the tropics and widen their range by the creation of new species with new fundamental and realized niches. 
> Not a bad summary, but becareful to make sure that your discussion of data/methods and interpretations align!

####Things you liked about the paper
I think that figure one with the latitudinal response curve was helpful in visualizing the gradient theory and its terms. I think bringing statistical analyses into geology is a helpful tool, and this study was a good representation of how it can be useful. I also liked that the authors not only compared data from an epoch-epoch level, but they also compared data from stage-stage data, which helps to back up their conclusion. 
> The quantitative/statistical approach to hypothesis testing is really very common in Paleobiology (the journal and the discipline)! It is less common than you might think in much of geoscience.

####Things you did not like about the paper
There were many statistical methods used in the paper which I felt could have been more clearly explained, for example the bootstrapping procedure. I would have also liked to have graphics of a small set of bivalve genera that was used in the study. This could also be represented with a specific case study, with a map of the globe and one genera of bivalves depicted throughout a set time period, and different colors representing changes in time. This could also be done with the idea of bridge species, which I felt could also be better defined within the paper.  
> Reading the primary literature can be challenging, and one of the biggest challenges is fully understanding the methods. It is common for authors to assume that their readers know a lot (which is sometimes not the case). We hope that the ability to better read the litereature and learn methods (as well as science) from it will be one of the things that you get out of this course.

####Evaluate the graphs and figures
Figure one is a representation of the latitudinal response curve that is used for the study. It depicts gradient theory in terms of peak abundance, latitudinal tolerance and preferred latitude. I think the figure was a good visual representation of the gradient theory and was described well in the notes. 
Figure two was various small graphs of preferred latitudes and latitudinal tolerance in cross plots. It shows various values related to the linear regression model for each plot. I found this figure to be quite confusing. It is unclear which values belong to each plot. Most of the linear regressions are fairly horizontal, so I am not sure why it was a necessary figure to include in the paper. 
Figure three shows two graphs showing the hollow curve that forms for each time period for both latitudinal tolerance and degrees of latitude shifted in preferred latitude. The figure clearly shows how for both variables each of the different time periods form a very similar curve. 
Table one shows the differences in the original mean and the bootstrapped mean, along with the p-values for each period interval. The table clearly displays the information, but neither the description nor the paper itself goes into detail about bootstrapping procedures. I think it would be helpful to describe what this means and why this information is relevant to the paper. 
Figure four show two graphs showing the hollow curve that forms for each time period in the Cenozoic for both latitudinal tolerance and degrees of latitude. It is quite similar to figure three, but shows more confined periods of time. The figure clearly shows how for both variables the data still forms the hollow curve, and is additional evidence for the authors’ argument. 
Figure five is a histogram of number of Paleobiology Database occurrences for different epochs, and also shows the variation in tropical and extratropical occurrences. The figure clearly shows the disparity between tropical and extratropical occurrences, and supports the authors’ theory that disproportionate sampling is not a bias in the Paleobiology Database. 
> Rather than recapping each figure/table you could comment on the highlights. That is, which was effective (or not) for communicating one of the main results? Overall, not a bad summary!
