## Article Summary

Benthic marine invertebrate fossil occurrences in PBDB are used to test the association between geographic range size and survivorship over the Phanerozoic. They find that a large geographic range size is an important predictor for survivorship over most of the geologic record, with the exception being during mass extinction events. Log-odds are used to test the data, and compare the odds of surviving against going extinct. At each of the five mass extinctions, the odds of survivorship are at the lowest points, each are at zero (or nearly zero). Species richness and occurrence frequency is also analyzed, but neither show as strong of a relationship with survivorship as does geographic range size. Overall, extinction was found to be more sensitive to geographic range size when per-plate extinction intensity is low. Therefore, when extinction rate per plate increases, differences in geographic range size has a smaller effect on relative extinction risk.

## Things you liked about the paper

I liked that rather than using standard linear regression, they used logistic regression. This way the outcome of extinction vs survival is binary/twofold rather than continuous. I thought this made the results easy to interpret both in reading and in graph form.  In addition, they confined the data to just benthic taxa in order to exclude other biogeographic factors, which helped to verify the results of the study. The data was also restrained to genera after the earliest Cambrian interval to the middle Mesozoic because outside of this range there were two few records to be substantial in the analysis. 

## Things you did not like about the paper

I did not like that the last model that was created was based on the assumption that all ecological and physiological attributes have no effect on extinction risk, and that no genus is assumed to be more or less susceptible to extinction than any other, regardless of the extinction causing process. We can attribute many global events that are believed to be a cause of mass extinction. For example, if global warming is the cause for an extinction event, it is possible that some taxon are more adapted to survive the rising temperatures and carbon dioxide levels. Events like the asteroid impact at the end Cretaceous would have global implications, but different species would still be affected differently. Different species have different susceptibilities to extinction risk.

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

Figure one shows the Phanerozoic trends in the geographic range size selectivity of genus survivorship. It show the log odds of selectivity vs time. For both graphs, the log odds of survivorship are at nearly zero for all 5 mass extinctions. The graphs represent the findings of the data clearly, and I think the log odds was a good choice to use to show the variance in survivorship.

Figure two is a graph of geographic range selectivity in log odds vs extinction intensity. The majority of the graph seems to not have much meaning, but the big five mass extinctions are all denoted and are located near one another, all near the zero mark of the y axis. It is difficult to quickly see the overall trends of the different time periods listed, but if it was in color (maybe it is, but not what I printed) it might be easier to see. 

Figure three is a graph of observed geographic range selectivity vs expected geographic range selectivity, both in log odds and assuming that extinctions were entirely independent across plates. I don’t like the graph, because it assumes that extinctions across plates are unrelated, which we know is not true for all mass extinction events.
